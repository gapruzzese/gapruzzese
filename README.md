## About Me

My name is Gerard Apruzzese (he/him).

I am a second year MPA student at Columbia SIPA, studying Urban Policy and Data Analytics. I have experience in Python, R, STATA, HTML, CSS, and PHP, specifically used to research evictions in the San Francisco Bay Area and the United States undocumented population.
